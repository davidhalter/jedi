# ----------------
# recursions
# ----------------

# Recursion settings are important if you don't want extremly recursive python
# code to go absolutely crazy. First of there is a global limit
# `max_executions`. This limit is important, to set a maximum amount of time,
# the completion may use.
#
# The `max_until_execution_unique` limit is probably the most important one,
# because if that limit is passed, functions can only be one time executed. So
# new functions will be executed, complex recursions with the same functions
# again and again, are ignored.
#
# `max_function_recursion_level` is more about whether the recursions are
# stopped in deepth or in width. The ratio beetween this and
# `max_until_execution_unique` is important here. It stops a recursion (after
# the number of function calls in the recursion), if it was already used
# earlier.
#
# The values are based on my experimental tries, used on the jedi library. But
# I don't think there's any other Python library, that uses recursion in a
# similar (extreme) way. This makes the completion definitely worse in some
# cases. But a completion should also be fast.

max_until_execution_unique = 50
