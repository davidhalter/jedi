    Install Jedi completer to :mod:`readline`.

    This function setups :mod:`readline` to use Jedi in Python interactive
    shell.  If you want to use a custom ``PYTHONSTARTUP`` file (typically
    ``$HOME/.pythonrc.py``), you can add this piece of code::

            from jedi.utils import setup_readline

        except ImportError:

            except ImportError:
                print("Readline is not installed either. No tab completion is enabled.")

    This will fallback to the readline completer if Jedi is not installed.
    The readline completer will only complete names in the global namespace,
    so for example,

    >>> ran<TAB> # doctest: +SKIP

    will complete to ``range``

    with both Jedi and readline, but

    >>> range(10).cou<TAB> # doctest: +SKIP

    will show complete to ``range(10).count`` only with Jedi.

    You'll also need to add ``export PYTHONSTARTUP=$HOME/.pythonrc.py`` to
    your shell profile (usually ``.bash_profile`` or ``.profile`` if you use
    bash).
