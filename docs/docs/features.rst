Features and Caveats
====================

|jedi| supports many of the widely used Python features:


General Features
----------------

- python 2.6+ and 3.2+ support
- ignores syntax errors and wrong indentation
- can deal with complex module / function / class structures
- virtualenv support
- can infer function arguments from sphinx and epydoc docstrings (:ref:`type
  hinting <type-hinting>`)


Supported Python Features
-------------------------

- builtins
- multiple returns or yields
- tuple assignments / array indexing / dictionary indexing
- with-statement / exception handling
- ``*args`` / ``**kwargs``
- decorators / lambdas / closures
- generators / iterators
- some descriptors: property / staticmethod / classmethod
- some magic methods: ``__call__``, ``__iter__``, ``__next__``, ``__get__``,
  ``__getitem__``, ``__init__``
- ``list.append()``, ``set.add()``, ``list.extend()``, etc.
- (nested) list comprehensions / ternary expressions
- relative imports
- ``getattr()`` / ``__getattr__`` / ``__getattribute__``
- function annotations (py3k feature, are ignored right now, but being parsed.
  I don't know what to do with them.)
- class decorators (py3k feature, are being ignored too, until I find a use
  case, that doesn't work with |jedi|)
- simple/usual ``sys.path`` modifications
- ``isinstance`` checks for if/while/assert
- namespace packages (includes ``pkgutil`` and ``pkg_resources`` namespaces)


Unsupported Features
--------------------

Not yet implemented:

- manipulations of instances outside the instance variables without using
  methods

Will probably never be implemented:

- metaclasses (how could an auto-completion ever support this)
- ``setattr()``, ``__import__()``
- writing to some dicts: ``globals()``, ``locals()``, ``object.__dict__``
- evaluating ``if`` / ``while``


Caveats
-------

**Malformed Syntax**

Syntax errors and other strange stuff may lead to undefined behaviour of the
completion. |jedi| is **NOT** a Python compiler, that tries to correct you. It
is a tool that wants to help you. But **YOU** have to know Python, not |jedi|.

**Legacy Python 2 Features**

This framework should work for both Python 2/3. However, some things were just
not as *pythonic* in Python 2 as things should be. To keep things simple, some
older Python 2 features have been left out:

- Classes: Always Python 3 like, therefore all classes inherit from ``object``.
- Generators: No ``next()`` method. The ``__next__()`` method is used instead.

**Slow Performance**

Importing ``numpy`` can be quite slow sometimes, as well as loading the
builtins the first time. If you want to speed things up, you could write import
hooks in |jedi|, which preload stuff. However, once loaded, this is not a
problem anymore.  The same is true for huge modules like ``PySide``, ``wx``,
etc.

**Security**

Security is an important issue for |jedi|. Therefore no Python code is
executed.  As long as you write pure python, everything is evaluated
statically. But: If you use builtin modules (``c_builtin``) there is no other
option than to execute those modules. However: Execute isn't that critical (as
e.g. in pythoncomplete, which used to execute *every* import!), because it
means one import and no more.  So basically the only dangerous thing is using
the import itself. If your ``c_builtin`` uses some strange initializations, it
might be dangerous. But if it does you're screwed anyways, because eventualy
you're going to execute your code, which executes the import.
