Pull Requests are great (on the **dev** branch)! Readme/Documentation changes
are ok in the master branch.

 1. Fork the Repo on github.
 2. If you are adding functionality or fixing a bug, please add a test!
 3. Add your name to AUTHORS.txt
 4. Push to your fork and submit a **pull request to the dev branch**.

My **master** branch is a 100% stable (should be). I only push to it after I am
certain that things are working out. Many people are using Jedi directly from
the github master branch.

Please use Pep8 to style your code.
