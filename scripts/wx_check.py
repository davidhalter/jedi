Depends: ``objgraph`` (third party Python library)

``wx._core`` is a very nice module to test Jedi's speed and memory performance
on big Python modules. Its size is ~16kLOC (one file). It also seems to look
like a typical big Python modules. A mix between a lot of different Python
things.

You can view a markup version of it here:
